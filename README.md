## Information about the dataset
Nowadays, most people buy online. This allows us to have a lot of data about the products and how they are received by the customers. It's very important when developing a new product to make sure it's something people will want to buy. So we can use all the data collected from online stores to predict if a product will have a good acceptance or not, and improve before releasing it if it doesn't.

In this case, we have information about all the different products of the Sephora online store. Sephora is a store specialized in cosmetics. Our goal will be to train different models in order to predict with the best accuracy as possible if the consumers of the store will like a product or not.
